# 4-Code-Quiz

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions as a means to familiarize the user with tests that are a part of the interview process in becoming a full-stack web developer. In using dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code, this app will be run in the browser with a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
In order to meet the Acceptance Criteria of the project:
* clicking the start button will begin a timer and present the first question
* answering a question correctly will present the next question
* an incorrect answer will subtract from the timer
* when all the questions are answered or when the timer reaches 0, the game will end
* the score and initials of the user can be submitted to a highscore list
